# Single-molecule_FRET_histogram_analysis

One widely used method of single-molecule FRET spectroscopy is the acquisition of intensity time traces from immobilized molecules using TIRF microscopy. This widefiled technique allows a quick recording of hundreds to thousends of time traces in parallel with a time resolution of a few milliseconds. It is pretty common to collect then FRET efficiency histograms using all recorded time points of selected time trace regions. This can lead to a relatively fast accumulation of smooth distributions. However, in the case there the time average of the system has not reached the ensemble average wrong conclusions are infered from the observed populations.
